/**
 * Waitlist signup — email-bombing hardening.
 *
 * The route used to fire a Resend confirmation email on every POST that
 * carried an email field, regardless of whether the insert actually
 * created a new row. Combined with the route's own 23505 swallow (treating
 * unique-violation as "already on the list, idempotent"), that meant
 * resubmitting the same {email} payload from rotating IPs caused the
 * same victim's inbox to be flooded — once per request. The middleware's
 * 120 req/min/IP rate limit was trivially bypassed with residential
 * proxies, and there was no per-email or global ceiling on the Resend
 * send rate.
 *
 * The fix is three-layered:
 *   (1) capture isDuplicate from the insert error and skip the send when
 *       set — Resend send count == new-row count.
 *   (2) per-email Upstash limiter (1/24h) backstops a future regression
 *       of the unique-on-lower(email) index.
 *   (3) global hourly Upstash cap (default 500/h, tunable via
 *       WAITLIST_EMAIL_HOURLY_CAP) bounds Resend quota burn under the
 *       fresh-victims-mass-signup variant where layer 1 and 2 don't help.
 *
 * This test guards the route source so a future "let's just fire the
 * mail unconditionally again" refactor trips the suite.
