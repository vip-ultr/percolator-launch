/**
 * Percolator on-chain program error code to human-readable message mappings.
 * 
 * Provides user-friendly explanations for blockchain transaction errors returned by the Percolator program.
 * Each numeric code maps 1:1 to the PercolatorError enum defined in program/src/percolator.rs.
 * 
 * Used by:
 * - API error responses (translateProgram Errors)
 * - Frontend error dialogs
 * - Transaction simulation to predict failures
 * 
 * When a Solana transaction fails with a Percolator custom error, the error code number
 * is extracted and looked up here to display context-appropriate text to the user.
